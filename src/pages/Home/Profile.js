              My name is Rawin Deeboonchai, nicknamed Pun.
              But I usually let people call me <span style={{color: '#63B3ED', fontWeight:'bold'}}>Robin</span> for the sake of simplicity.<br/>

              <span style={{color: '#63B3ED', fontWeight:'bold'}}>comtalyst</span> is my digital codename, originate from the word "computing" and "catalyst."

              Bangkok, Thailand is my hometown. 
              However, I am currently pursuing my undergraduate degree in the United States 
              at the University of Wisconsin-Madison as a rising junior, as of 2021.

              My brightest passion and dreams are always around computing and digital technologies since I was very young.
              This prompts me to begin my journey of pursuing a career in Computer Science and Data Science when I was in high school.
              Since then, I keep seeking more knowledge about the things that lie ahead without having to wait for the predefined curriculum 
              defined by the formal education system. Throughout my almost-a-decade-long journey, I discover many new things outside of the classroom
              apart from technical knowledge that might be helpful for my careers such as soft skills, connections, leadership opportunities, 
              or even life lessons and philosophy.

              But, if I were to talk more on the technical side, I believe the topics that catch my attention the most in meantime are 
              Full-Stack Development and Machine Learning. In the past, during high school years, my major focus was
              Data Structures and Algorithms, which is my main weapon for programming competitions at advanced levels.
              I recently decided to explore more on the applications of computer science through the two topics I mentioned.
              Despite this, I am still confident in my algorithmic skills, as I still practice programming problems and participate
              in several competitions. Anyway, tangible traces of my exploration in these topics are visible through my projects and 
              participations that will be listed below on this website. Feel free to explore!

              The end of my journey is still far from reach, but maybe the fun part is what I experience during the journey itself, right?
